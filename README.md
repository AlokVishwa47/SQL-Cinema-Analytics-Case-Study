🎬 Cinema & Infrastructure Analytics Case Study

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from relational databases containing movie performance and corporate infrastructure data. The goal was to solve business questions using advanced SQL techniques such as multi-table joins, data filtering, and handling incomplete datasets.

🛠 Tech Stack & Skills
* **Language:** SQL
* **Concepts:** * **Joins:** Inner Join and Left Join (to merge disparate datasets).
    * **Data Integrity:** Handling `NULL` values and ensuring data accuracy.
    * **Filtering:** Utilizing `DISTINCT` and `WHERE` clauses for specific data retrieval.
    * **Sorting:** Applying `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` for ranked reporting.

🔍 Key Business Insights
* **Infrastructure Optimization:** Identified underutilized corporate buildings by performing a `LEFT JOIN` between buildings and employees to locate `NULL` assignments.
* **Performance Analysis:** Merged movie metadata with box office sales to rank top-performing titles globally.
* **Data Quality:** Cleaned and filtered results to remove duplicate entries and focus on unique organizational structures.

📂 Repository Structure
* `queries.sql`: Contains the full technical implementation of the analysis.
* `README.md`: Project documentation and summary of findings.

* ### 📂 Excel Data Cleaning Project
**Objective:** To transform a raw, inconsistent dataset into a standardized format ready for analysis.
**Techniques Used:**
* **Data Scrubbing:** Utilized `TRIM()` and `PROPER()` functions to fix formatting errors.
* **Data Integrity:** Applied 'Remove Duplicates' to eliminate redundant entries.
* **Standardization:** Used 'Find & Replace' to unify inconsistent categorical data (e.g., standardizing city names).

## 🛠️ Advanced SQL Mastery (Creator Level)
I have transitioned from data retrieval to full-scale **Database Management**. My recent focus has been on handling relational data and ensuring database integrity.

* **Data Manipulation:** Mastered `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands to manage real-time business records.
* **Relational Mapping:** Currently mastering **JOINS** to connect multiple data entities and extract complex business insights.
* **Data Cleaning via SQL:** Using conditional filtering to ensure only high-quality data is processed for analysis.

## 🎬 Project: Cinema Data Intelligence Analysis
**Objective:** To analyze movie performance and audience engagement by connecting multiple relational datasets.

**Key Analytical Tasks Performed:**
1. **Performance Tracking:** Used `INNER JOIN` to merge Movie details with Box Office collections to identify the highest ROI films.
2. **Missing Data Audit:** Applied `LEFT JOIN` and `IS NULL` logic to find movies that haven't been rated or haven't reported revenue.
3. **Profit Analysis:** Created SQL Expressions to calculate 'Domestic vs International' revenue ratios.
